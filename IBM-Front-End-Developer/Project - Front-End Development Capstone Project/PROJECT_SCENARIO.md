# Project Scenario: StayHealthy Inc. Website Development

**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

## Scenario Overview

StayHealthy Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare facilities in remote areas with minimal to no medical resources. The Executive Director has started the **Go Digital** initiative to help increase the reach of StayHealthyâ€™s services. One of the key aspects of this initiative is building a website that will allow patients to access doctors anytime, anywhere, improving healthcare delivery in underserved areas.

You, as a front-end developer, have been assigned to design and develop this website.

## Problem Statement

StayHealthy conducted a survey to assess healthcare facilities in remote areas. The results showed that many patients have a difficult time finding doctors due to a lack of medical resources within a 50-mile radius, or long wait times for consultations. Many emergencies have been made worse by the inability to see a doctor in a timely manner.

Given the increase in internet and broadband availability in these areas, StayHealthy aims to build a website to help patients connect with general physicians and specialists in real time.

- **User-friendly**
- **Intuitive**

4. **Profile Management**

   - Users should have the ability to update their profile details.
